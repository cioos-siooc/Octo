However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\nCovered Software is provided under this License on an “as is”\nbasis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or\nstatutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the\nCovered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a\nparticular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the\nquality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\nShould any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You\n(not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,\nrepair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an\nessential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is\nauthorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\nUnder no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort\n(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any\nContributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as\npermitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,\nspecial, incidental, or consequential damages of any character\nincluding, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\ngoodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any\nand all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party\nshall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This\nlimitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or\npersonal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the\nextent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some\njurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of\nincidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and\nlimitation may not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\ncourts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\nplace of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\njurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\nNothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\ncross-claims or counter-claims.\n9. Miscellaneous\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n10.
